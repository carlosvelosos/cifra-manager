# Highlight Toggle & Hide Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented toggles in the floating menu settings to enable/disable each type of highlight function AND hide specific types of lines completely from the CifraDisplay component.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Highlight Context Provider (`lib/highlight-context.tsx`)

- Created React context to manage highlight and hide settings globally
- Stores settings in localStorage for persistence
- Provides hooks for components to access and modify settings
- Default state: all highlights enabled, all hides disabled
- **NEW**: Added hide controls for each line type

### 2. Settings Toggles in Floating Menu (`components/floating-menu.tsx`)

- Added six toggle buttons in the settings menu:

  **Highlight Features:**

  - **Tab blocks** - Red toggle (controls tab block highlighting)
  - **Parte sections** - Blue toggle (controls "Parte _ de _" highlighting)
  - **Bracket sections** - Green toggle (controls "[*]" highlighting)

  **Hide Lines:**

  - **Hide tab blocks** - Red toggle (completely hides tab blocks and context lines)
  - **Hide parte sections** - Blue toggle (completely hides "Parte _ de _" lines)
  - **Hide bracket sections** - Green toggle (completely hides "[*]" lines)

- Toggle buttons show colored background when enabled, matching highlight colors
- Settings persist across sessions using localStorage
- Integrated with existing floating menu settings

### 3. Updated CifraDisplay Component (`components/cifra-display.tsx`)

- Made component client-side to use React hooks
- Added `filterHiddenLines` function to remove hidden line types
- Updated renderProcessedText function to accept highlight settings
- Processes lines in this order:
  1. Identify all line types (tab, parte, bracket)
  2. Filter out hidden lines based on hide settings
  3. Split remaining lines into columns
  4. Apply highlighting to visible lines
- Maintains priority system: bracket > parte > tab/context
- Uses highlight context to get current settings

### 4. Root Layout Integration (`app/layout.tsx`)

- Wrapped application with HighlightProvider context
- Ensures highlight and hide settings are available throughout the app

## How It Works

### Settings UI

1. Click the "Settings" button in the floating menu
2. In the "Highlight Features" section, toggle any combination of:
   - Tab blocks (red)
   - Parte sections (blue)
   - Bracket sections (green)
3. In the "Hide Lines" section, toggle any combination of:
   - Hide tab blocks (red)
   - Hide parte sections (blue)
   - Hide bracket sections (green)
4. Changes are immediately applied and saved to localStorage

### Processing Logic

- Each line is still processed to detect all highlight types
- Lines matching hide criteria are completely removed from display
- Remaining lines have highlighting applied if the corresponding toggle is enabled
- Priority system ensures no conflicts when multiple types apply to same line
- Hidden lines don't appear in the rendered content at all

### Use Cases

- **Hide tab blocks**: Great for viewing only lyrics and chord progressions
- **Hide parte sections**: Useful when you don't need section markers
- **Hide bracket sections**: Clean up display by removing section headers
- **Combine settings**: Hide certain types while highlighting others

## Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite (`test-hide-functionality.js`)
- Verified all hide combinations work correctly
- Tested filtering with various line type combinations
- No compilation errors or runtime issues
- Verified with real cifra content in browser

## Files Modified

1. `lib/highlight-context.tsx` - Added hide settings to context provider
2. `components/floating-menu.tsx` - Added hide toggle UI section
3. `components/cifra-display.tsx` - Added filtering logic and updated processing
4. `test-hide-functionality.js` - New test file for hide validation

## Technical Details

- Uses React Context API for state management
- LocalStorage persistence ensures settings survive page refreshes
- **Hydration-safe**: Prevents SSR/client mismatch by using mounted state
- Client-side rendering for components that use context
- Backwards compatible - all highlights enabled, all hides disabled by default
- Filtering happens before column splitting for optimal performance
- Hide settings take precedence over highlight settings (hidden lines are never highlighted)

## Hydration Fix

To prevent React hydration errors, the implementation uses a two-phase approach:

1. **Initial render**: Uses default values (highlights enabled, hiding disabled) that match server-side rendering
2. **After mounting**: Loads localStorage values and re-renders with user preferences
3. **Mounted state**: Prevents localStorage access during SSR while ensuring smooth client-side updates

## Visual Design

- Toggle buttons use colors matching their line types
- Clear section separation: "Highlight Features" and "Hide Lines"
- Consistent styling with existing settings menu
- Immediate visual feedback when toggling
- Color-coded buttons make it easy to understand which setting affects which line type

## Advanced Usage

Users can now:

- Selectively highlight certain line types while hiding others
- Create custom views (e.g., lyrics-only by hiding tabs and brackets)
- Toggle between different display modes instantly
- Combine highlighting and hiding for precise content control

The implementation is complete, thoroughly tested, and ready for production use. Users have full control over both highlighting and visibility of all line types in the cifra display.
