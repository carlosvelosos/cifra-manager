## Props

| Prop                | Type     | Required | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

| `description`       | `string` | ‚ùå       | Optional artist description shown below the name  |

## Implementation Details

### State Management

- `songs`: Full list of artist songs
- `filteredSongs`: Filtered songs based on search term
- `loading`: Loading state for API calls
- `searchTerm`: Current search input value

### API Integration

- Fetches songs from `/api/songs/[artistSlug]`
- Handles loading and error states gracefully
- Formats song titles from URL slugs

### Search Algorithm

- Case-insensitive text matching
- Searches in song titles
- Real-time filtering without debouncing (efficient for small datasets)

## Accessibility

- ‚úÖ Proper semantic HTML structure
- ‚úÖ Screen reader friendly labels
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation support
- ‚úÖ Focus management
- ‚úÖ ARIA attributes where needed

## Design System Integration

The component integrates seamlessly with the existing design system:

- Uses shadcn/ui components (`Card`, `Button`, `Input`)
- Follows established color tokens and spacing
- Maintains consistent typography scales
- Responsive breakpoints aligned with design system

## Migration Guide

### Before (Old Artist Pages)

```tsx
// Duplicate code in each artist page
const [songs, setSongs] = useState([]);
// ... repetitive logic
```

### After (New Artist Pages)

```tsx
// Simple, reusable component
<ArtistPage
  artistSlug="revelacao"
  artistDisplayName="Grupo Revela√ß√£o"
  description="Artist description..."
/>
```

## Benefits
