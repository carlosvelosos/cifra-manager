# Sidebar & Navigation Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Sidebar Not Visible

**Problem**: The sidebar was only 4px wide when not pinned, making it impossible to hover over and access.

**Fixed by**:

- Increasing unpinned width from `w-4` to `w-12`
- Adding visible handle with dots indicator
- Improving background styling with blur effect
- Adjusting translation values for better UX

### 2. Internal Server Errors

**Problem**: Build manifest file conflicts in development server.

**Fixed by**:

- Cleaning `.next` cache directory
- Restarting development server
- Server now running on http://localhost:3001

### 3. Navigation Access

**Problem**: No alternative way to access artist pages.

**Fixed by**:

- Adding "Quick Access" panel on home page
- Direct links to artists and documentation
- Updated layout margins for better spacing

## Current Status

✅ **Sidebar is now visible and accessible**

- Hover over the left edge (12px wide area with dots)
- Click the pin icon to keep it open
- Contains all artists and their songs

✅ **Artist pages are working**

- `/artists/revelacao` - Grupo Revelação
- `/artists/zeca-pagodinho` - Zeca Pagodinho
- All individual song pages accessible

✅ **APIs are functioning**

- `/api/artists` - Returns all artists and songs
- `/api/songs/[artist]` - Returns songs for specific artist

✅ **Quick navigation added**

- "Quick Access" panel on home page
- Direct links to both artists
- Link to documentation
