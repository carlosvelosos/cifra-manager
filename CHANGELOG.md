# Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2025-06-15

### 🎸 Enhanced Tab Block Detection & Highlighting

#### ✨ Added

- **Advanced tab notation support** - Handles all real-world guitar tab symbols including:
  - Multi-digit frets (10, 12, 15)
  - Muted strings (x)
  - Hammer-ons (h) and pull-offs (p)
  - Bends (b) and releases (r)
  - Slides (/, \) and vibrato (~)
  - Strumming arrows (↓, ↑)
- **Smart block identification** - Only highlights complete 6-line guitar tab blocks
- **Gap tolerance** - Allows up to 2 empty lines within tab blocks for better formatting
- **Context highlighting** - Highlights lines above and below tab blocks for visual clarity
- **Column-safe processing** - Prevents tab blocks from being split across columns
- **Enhanced regex pattern** - `/^[EBGDAE]\|[0-9\-~\.\/\\\|\sxhpbr↓↑]+\|?\s*$/`

#### 🔄 Changed

- **Enhanced CifraDisplay component** with improved tab detection algorithm
- **Updated song page parsing** to handle both Unix and Windows line endings
